                        <p>It's been a while... I'm back for the first time since summer break. Added colorful title cards, a new formating for the About page (hopefuly final), reworked some minor visual aspects, and fixed the compatibility issues between different galleries (1 col vs 3 col). Added a Blog post page, important for regular posts. This website is close to ready to start receiving content. I'd really like to finish the visual aspects before I start posting. Almost there... Things are looking good.</p>

                        <h3 id="08-2025">August 2025</h3>

                        <h4>29/08/2025</h4>

                        <p>Redesigned the whole content area. Replaced the boring white background with a paper texture, and rounded the corners. Added a title bubble to each of the main pages. Grouped every chunk of text in a bubble, also with rounded corners, and with a dashed border. Added the LEGO page, as well as the first post there! Added different backgrounds for every page outside of the main six. Everything looks a bit sillier now. I don't know how to feel about some of these changes, and maybe I'll undo some of them later.</p>
