                        <p>Est. July 8th 2025 - A place to quickly document the most fun and interesting things about each day! An abridged (and conveniently translated!) version of my personal diary.</p>

                        <p>Hey! It's been over a month since I last wrote here. I found it very taxing to write every day in two different places and in two different languages (my personal diary in Portuguese and this microblog in English). I think this page will serve other purposes in the future. Maybe I'll use it to log every major change I make to this website. Today marks the first time I'm even opening this place since last month. I spent the evening writing the About page and browsing my list of cool websites looking for inspiration. I really want to spend more of my online time here. I feel like writing, but I don't know what to write about. For now, I'll just keep perfecting the About page. Take care :)</p>

                        <p>Morning at home, once again working on this Website. Things are going well, the Website is looking good, and I really want to start writing again. I want to get back to album reviews. I only wrote a couple of those in the previous iteration of the Blog. I have so much music to write about. After lunch, I went shopping for clothes with Raquel. I bought two t-shirts and a pair of shorts at H&M. I really need more quality clothing. Most of what I own is already way too old, and lots of stuff doesn't even fit anymore. It's midnight now. The moon is still nearly full. I just want to soak in the night air. It's all so refreshing, now that I don't have to worry about anything. I love nights like these. I wish I had rested more this year. Today I received my last grade - a terrible 8.5 in my Thermodynamics test. 14 is my final grade, the lowest one yet. I'm starting to realize that grades really aren't that important. Maybe now I'll start resting more, and allowing myself to breathe every now and then.</p>

                        <p>Day at home, doin' my silly projects. Spent the morning recording guitars for the Meshuggah cover I've been working on for a while. It turned out pretty good, I just need to rework the busier sections, when there are a few layers of guitars playing at the same time - it gets a bit confusing. Spent the afternoon working on my Website (yes, this one!), after a really long time without even touching it. Hopefully things around here will start looking a lot nicer. Making websites is quite a lot of fun. I'm thinking I should make more after I'm "done" with this one and try to build some kind of portfolio. You never know. Worst case scenario - I have fun learning and building websites. Raquel stopped by for dinner, and we compiled a list of places to visit next week in Toulouse. Really excited about that.</p>

                        <p>Another amazing day. Woke up at 9am, spent the morning trying to fix the noise coming from my guitar every time I tried to record anything. Found out it's probably caused by electricity itself, since I got the best results by placing myself far away from any electrical outlets. Oh well, I'll just have to record everything on my laptop. Went to the gym with Raquel and Carolina in the afternoon. It was my first time in my local gym, which isn't well maintained, at least compared to the one I usually go to in Lisbon, but it will do nicely. The three of us spent the rest of the afternoon, until close to 9pm, in Raquel's pool, then ate pizza and watched a horror movie (Smile, I think). It's great to have slow, relaxed days like these. Who knows how long it's been since I've had one. It's also really nice to finally reduce screen time on all devices. Great times.</p>

                        <p>First official day of summer break! Raquel and I took the bus from Lisbon to Faro early in the morning, ate McDonald's in Faro and spent the rest of the afternoon in her pool. Overwhelmingly excited to finally rest, after such a long and exhausting year. It's gonna be fun, I hope :)</p>
