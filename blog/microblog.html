            <p>Another amazing day. Woke up at 9am, spent the morning busy trying to fix the noise coming from my guitar every time I try to record anything. Found out it's probably caused by electricity itself, since I got the best results placing myself far away from any electrical outlets. Oh well, I'll just have to record everything on my laptop. Went to the gym with Raquel and Carolina in the afternoon. First time in my local gym, which isn't well maintained, at least compared to the one I usually go to in Lisbon. It will do nicely. The three of us spent the rest of the afternoon, until almost 9pm, in Raquel's pool, then ate pizza and watched a silly horror movie (Smile, I think). It's great to have slow, relaxed days like these. Who knows how long it's been since I've had one. It's also really nice to finally reduce screen time on all devices. Great times.</p>

            <p>First official day of summer break! Raquel and I took the bus from Lisbon to Faro early in the morning, ate McDonald's in Faro and spent the rest of the afternoon in her pool. Overwhelmingly excited to finally rest, after such a long and exhausting year. It's gonna be fun, I hope :)</p>
