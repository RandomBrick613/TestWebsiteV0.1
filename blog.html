        <p>Hi! This is a very basic version of my website.</p>

        <h5>Tuesday, 21/01/2025</h5>

        <p>Hi!</p>
        <p>I feel like this is a good time to start writing here. Right now, this website is <strong>far</strong> from done. The structure is just barely defined, and anything related to CSS or JS is yet to be seen. I suspect it will remain this way for a while. For now, I have things to write about. I'll worry about the presentation later.</p>
        <p>Tomorrow I'm leaving for Lisbon. I spent the last twelve days at home, mostly studying for my exams. Three days, three exams. That's what the rest of this week holds for me. I have very low expectations. I can retake them in two weeks, but I would love to have some time off. It sucks.</p>
        <p>I'll be taking the train to Lisbon. It's been around nine months since I last took the train. The buses are always cheaper, but this time I'll have to go early in the morning, and by the time I looked up the bus prices, they were already higher than usual. Train it is. I like it better. Traveling through the familiar landscape will be comforting. Anything to keep me from stressing out and thinking of the exams ahead.</p>
        <p>Today was a nice day. A good night's sleep was able to release me from yesterday's not so great mood. I spent most of the day studying, like usual, but I didn't feel as pressured. The day was gray and windy. It rained less than yesterday, but the winds were stronger. I spent some time in the balcony, as I always do, admiring the landscape and taking photos. I'll try to post a couple of them here once I have time. Even though the weather was unpleasant, it was a nice change of pace from the weeks of sunshine that came before. I need this kind of weather too, sometimes. And in this time of year, I need it more than the warm sunny days.</p>
        <p>I went to Raquel's for dinner with her family. They wished me luck on my exams. It's always pleasant being with them. When I came home I was confronted with a familiar sound. One that brought me joy precisely twelve months ago. The frogs were back. I cannot believe it's been almost a full year since I last heard them. But it was last February, as I was going to bed the day before heading to Lisbon to start the new semester, that I last heard their croaking. I love frogs. All it took was two days of rain and they're already back. I'm once again laying in bed, listening to the frogs. A whole year has passed. The wind is picking up, drowning out the melodic croaks. I hope they're still around when I come back on Saturday. If so, I'll go on a little adventure to find them.</p>
        <p> Wish me luck.</p>


        <h5>Saturday, 25/01/2025</h5>

        <p>Hi!</p>
        <p>I'm back home. The exams are done. It's safe to say it went way better than I thought it would.</p>
        <p>Wednesday I woke up early. I got on the train at 8:20 and got some rest, to compensate for the very short night of sleep. Well, I rested until the train stopped in the middle of nowhere, and we all had to get off. There was some kind of problem on the tracks ahead, and the train couldn't go any further. Later I found out that due to bad weather, a small tornado formed and caused some chaos near Lisbon, affecting the tracks. Unlucky me. It wouldn't be much of an issue, except my first exam was four hours away. Thankfully, a few buses were dispatched and I arrived on time. The first exam was alright. It was for a silly little class named Technology and Society, and I wasn't concerned about it. I barely studied, but it wouldn't have made a difference. It was basically a philosophy test. Not my specialty, but it was fine. Even if I don't get an amazing grade, I'll be happy as long as I pass the class.</p>
        <p>On Thursday I had my second exam. Numerical Analysis is a class I've grown to like. At first, I thought it wouldn't be my thing, but I guess I was wrong. I studied a lot for this one, and thankfully it went smoothly.</p>
        <p>Last but certainly not least, the exam I was most worried about, Electromagnetism and Optics. I was very pessimistic about it. Last time was hell. It broke the record for my lowest grade since I joined university. I would probably have to retake that one, or the one I was about to take, if it was even worse. The only scenario where I wouldn't retake anything was if I got a 20 on this one. In that case, I would finish the class with a decent grade and I would be happy. In that unlikely situation, I would have three weeks off. The odds were slim. Somehow, I think I might have pulled it off. I haven't received the grade yet, but I am confident. I shouldn't declare victory yet, but there's a good chance I'm already done with the first semester.</p>
        <p>It's now Saturday. I'm back home after three days in Lisbon. I'm still waiting for the grades. I'm hopeful. I need to rest now. I took the day off, and tomorrow will be the same. I really hope I can get the next three weeks off. All I need is that 20. And then I'm set.</p>
