        <p>Hi! This is a very basic version of my website.</p>

        <h5>Tuesday, 21/01/2025</h5>

        <p>Hi!</p>
        <p>I feel like this is a good time to start writing here. Right now, this website is <strong>far</strong> from done. The structure is just barely defined, and anything related to CSS or JS is yet to be seen. I suspect it will remain this way for a while. For now, I have things to write about. I'll worry about the presentation later.</p>
        <p>Tomorrow I'm leaving for Lisbon. I spent the last twelve days at home, mostly studying for my exams. Three days, three exams. That's what the rest of this week holds for me. I have very low expectations. I can retake them in two weeks, but I would love to have some time off. It sucks.</p>
        <p>I'll be taking the train to Lisbon. It's been around nine months since I last took the train. The buses are always cheaper, but this time I'll have to go early in the morning, and by the time I looked up the bus prices, they were already higher than usual. Train it is. I like it better. Traveling through the familiar landscape will be comforting. Anything to keep me from stressing out and thinking of the exams ahead.</p>
        <p>Today was a nice day. A good night's sleep was able to release me from yesterday's not so great mood. I spent most of the day studying, like usual, but I didn't feel as pressured. The day was gray and windy. It rained less than yesterday, but the winds were stronger. I spent some time in the balcony, as I always do, admiring the landscape and taking photos. I'll try to post a couple of them here once I have time. Even though the weather was unpleasant, it was a nice change of pace from the weeks of sunshine that came before. I need this kind of weather too, sometimes. And in this time of year, I need it more than the warm sunny days.</p>
        <p>I went to Raquel's for dinner with her family. They wished me luck on my exams. It's always nice being with them. When I came home I was confronted with a familiar sound. One that brought me joy precisely twelve months ago. The frogs were back. I cannot believe it's been almost a full year since I last heard them. But it was in last February, as I was going to bed the day before heading to Lisbon to start the new semester, that I last heard their croaking. I love frogs. All it took was two days of rain and they're already back. I'm once again laying in bed, listening to the frogs. A whole year has passed. The wind is picking up, drowning out the melodic croaks. I hope they're still around when I come back on Saturday. If so, I'll go on a little adventure to find them.</p>
        <p> Wish me luck.</p>
