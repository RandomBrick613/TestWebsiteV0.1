        <p>Hi! This is a very basic version of my website.</p>

        <h5>Tuesday, 22/01/2025</h5>

        <p>Hi!</p>
        <p>I feel like this is a good time to start writing here. Right now, this website is <strong>far</strong> from done. The structure is just barely defined, and anything related to CSS is yet to be seen. I suspect it will remain this way for a while. For now, I have things to write about. I'll worry about the presetation later.</p>
        <p>Tomorrow I'm leaving for Lisbon. I spent the last twelve days at home, mostly studying for my exams. Three days, three exams. That's what the rest of this weeks holds for me. I have very low expectations. I can retake them in two weeks, but I would love to have some time off. It sucks.</p>
        <p>I'll be taking the train to Lisbon. It's been around nine months since I last took the train. The buses are always cheaper, but this time I'll have to go early in the morning, and by the time I looked up the bus prices, they were already higher than usual. Train it is. I like it better. Traveling through the familiar landscape will be comforting. Anything to keep me from stressing out and thinking of the exams ahead.</p>
        <p>Today was a nice day. A good night's sleep was able to release me from yesterday's not so great mood. I spent most of the day studying, like usual, but I didn't feel as pressured. The day was gray and windy. It rained less than yesterday, but the winds were stronger. I spent some time in the balcony, as I always do, admiring the landscape and taking photos. I'll try to get a couple of them here once I have time. Even though the weather was unpleasant, it was a nice change of pace from the weeks of sunshine that came before. I need this weather too, sometimes. In this time of year, I might even need it more than the warm sunny days.</p>
        <p>I went to Raquel's for dinner with her family. They wished me luck on my exams. When I came home I was confronted with a familiar sound. One that brought me joy precisely twelve months ago. The frogs are back. I cannot believe it's been almost a full year since I last heard them. But it was in February of last year, as I was going to bed the day before going to Lisbon to start the new semester, that I last listened to their croaking. I love frogs. All it took was two days of rain and they're already back. I'm once again laying in bed, listening to the frogs. The wind is picking up, drowning out the melodic croaks. I love the frogs. I hope they're still around when I come back on Saturday. If so, I'll go on a little adventure to find them. Wish me luck.</p>
