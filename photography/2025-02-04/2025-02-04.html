                <p class="paragraph">These are most of the photos I took while on a short walk near Olhão.</p>

                <p class="paragraph">Dad and I left home early. He was going for his usual morning jog, and I decided to tag along, not only to photograph a new place but also to spend some time with him. We went to Marim, a small and well-kept park near Olhão. The weather was very pleasant, especially for an early February morning. Eventually, after dad had done a couple of laps around the park, we went into the Ria Formosa reserve, which bordered the park to the south, where I got some neat shots near the railway.</p>

                <p class="paragraph">I didn't take many photos. I tried shooting with intent, only clicking the shutter button when I felt like I had a decent frame. I decided to edit them to the best of my abilities. I went for a bright film look, one that obviously needs improving, but that I am reasonably happy with. In fact, I would say I'm quite content with these shots. I decided to post some of them on my newly rebranded Instagram account, which will hopefully serve as a separate archive of some of my favorite shots.</p>

                <p class="paragraph">Also, the bird shot was pure luck. It was taken with Sony's cheap kit lens (the only one I have right now...) at 50 mm. Thankfully I was able to crop in without losing much quality. Gotta love Sony's autofocus :)</p>
